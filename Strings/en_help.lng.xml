</string>

  <!-- === Topics === -->

	<string name="help_hunting_title">Hunting</string>
	<string name="help_hunting_description">
Using specialized tools, your people can hunt animals in order to obtain (b)food(/b) and (b)resources(/b) from them.
To start a hunt, select an animal in the environment and then click on the (b)hunt button(/b). Depending on the difficulty of the prey, and the availability of tools, a certain number of people will go after the animal.
Animals will react in different ways when being hunted: some will try to (b)escape(/b), others will protect their offspring or will try to (b)retaliate(/b).
You can control the hunt in more detail by selecting one or more adults and right clicking on a target animal.
	</string>	
	
	<string name="help_farming_title">Farming</string>
	<string name="help_farming_description">
Farming allows you to automate the production of (b)food(/b), and sustain more people in your settlement.
You can plant a variety of (b)crops(/b), then harvest and process them to feed your people. Crops are usually planted in winter or spring and collected in summer or autumn.
It is important to plant a (b)variety(/b) of crops as diseases can easily wipe out all the individuals of a single species.
In order to maximize the efficiency of the harvest, make sure you have enough (b)Sickles(/b) around.
Of all crops, (b)cereals(/b) are probably the most important, they are not only a source of (b)Grain(/b) but also (b)Straw(/b), which is a vital resource both as a building material and also as animal food.
	</string>
			
	<string name="help_defense_title">Defense</string>
	<string name="help_defense_description">
One of the keys to survival is to defend your settlement against hostile (b)animals(/b) and (b)raiders(/b).
During the (b)stone age(/b), the main threats are wild animals and sporadic bands of raiders. Make sure you have enough weapons and people to defend the settlement against them.
In the (b)metal age(/b) things will get more serious, and large bands of attackers will try to destroy your settlement. It is highly recommended that you build (b)fortifications(/b) and (b)defensive structures(/b).
At any time you can trigger an (b)alert(/b) in the defense panel, your people will then run back the settlement, get the best weapons available and man the towers.
	</string>	
	
	<string name="help_human_status_title">Human Status</string>
	<string name="help_human_status_description">
Humans have (b)health(/b), (b)nutrition(/b), (b)hydration(/b), (b)rest(/b), (b)temperature(/b), (b)stamina(/b) and (b)morale(/b) indicators that reflect their current status.
When an status indicator is low, a (b)warning sign(/b) will appear on top of that person, highlighting what's wrong with them.
Having sub-optimal status will make your people less effective, and eventually cause them to die. You need to monitor your people at all times and make sure their needs are fulfilled.
	</string>	
	
	<string name="help_health_title">Health</string>	
	<string name="help_health_description">
This is a measure of the physical health of a person. If it goes too low, the human will die.

    </string>	
	
	<string name="help_nutrition_title">Nutrition</string>	
	<string name="help_nutrition_description">
This is a measure of how well fed a person is. If it goes too low, (b)health(/b) will start to drop, and the human will eventually die.
(b)Nutrition(/b) can be recovered by eating food, which can be obtained from a variety of sources.
    </string>		
	
	<string name="help_hydration_title">Hydration</string>	
	<string name="help_hydration_description">
This is a measure of how thirsty a person is. If it goes too low, (b)health(/b) will start to drop, and the human will eventually die.
(b)Hydration(/b) can be recovered by drinking from a (b)river(/b), (b)lake(/b), (b)well(/b), or (b)stored water(/b).
    </string>	
	
	<string name="help_rest_title">Rest</string>	
	<string name="help_rest_description">

(b)Rest(/b) can be recovered by sleeping in a (b)Tent(/b), (b)Hut(/b) or (b)Roundhouse(/b).
    </string>
	
	<string name="help_temperature_title">Temperature</string>	
	<string name="help_temperature_description">
This is a measure of the body temperature of a person. If it goes too low, (b)health(/b) will start to drop, and the human will eventually die.
To warm themselves up, humans can wear thicker clothing or shelter inside a (b)Tent(/b), (b)Hut(/b) or (b)Roundhouse(/b).
    </string>		
	
	<string name="help_stamina_title">Stamina</string>	
	<string name="help_stamina_description">

(b)Stamina(/b) recovers automatically when idle.
    </string>		
	
	<string name="help_morale_title">Morale</string>	
	<string name="help_morale_description">
This is a measure of the psychological health of a person. If morale goes low, they will be (b)less effective at work(/b). Keeping morale high is therefore critical to the success of your settlement.
Morale can go down due to (b)hunger(/b), (b)deaths(/b), or performing (b)tedious tasks(/b), such as farming or carrying heavy loads.
Morale is increased by visiting one of the morale recovering structures like the (b)Skull Pole(/b), (b)Totem(/b), (b)Menhir(/b), (b)Dolmen(/b) or (b)Stone Circle(/b). More advanced morale structures recover more morale. 
A person has to wait a period of time before recovering again from the same type of structure, so it is important to build a variety of these.
Later in the game you can also produce (b)Beer(/b), which recovers a lot of morale, but needs to be made from Grain. 
	</string>			
	
  <string name="help_knowledge_title">Knowledge</string>
  <string name="help_knowledge_description">
You can earn (b)knowledge points(/b) in the game by achieving various goals:
• Reaching larger populations
• Building different types of structures
• Hunting different types of animals
• Acquiring the various resources
• Killing raiders

• Surviving more years
You can then use these points to unlock new (b)techs(/b), which allow you to advance your settlement and be able to sustain larger populations.
  </string>
	
	<string name="help_crafting_title">Crafting</string>
  <string name="help_crafting_description">
Your people can craft a variety of resources in the settlement's structures.
To craft a resource, select a (b)crafting structure(/b) and click on a recipe. If the resources are available, one of your people will craft it.

  </string>
	
	<string name="help_expanding_title">Expanding</string>
  <string name="help_expanding_description">
If your (b)welfare(/b) is high enough and you have enough capacity in your settlement, new people will come and join it, and your women will give (b)birth(/b) to new children.
You can increase your housing capacity by building (b)Tents(/b), (b)Huts(/b) or (b)Roundhouses(/b).
The frequency of migrant arrivals depends on your (b)welfare(/b) and (b)prestige(/b).
The fertility of your people also depends on your (b)welfare(/b) level.
  </string>	
  
  <string name="help_resource_limits_title">Resource Limits</string>
	<string name="help_resource_limits_description">
Resource Limits are a powerful way to automate work in your settlement.
You can set a (b)resource limit(/b), then mark a recipe for continuous production or place a work area: your people will keep on collecting or producing that resource until the limit is reached. 
When resources are consumed and the amounts fall below the limit again, your people will go back to work.
You can set any limit to 3 types of values:
(b)Infinity(/b). There's no limit to production, it will continue as long as there are materials available.
(b)Fixed amount(/b). Sets a limit defined by a specific number of units. Production stops once the number of units of that particular resource reaches the value.
(b)Population percentage(/b). Sets a limit defined by a percentage of the current population. Setting a percentage limit is useful to avoid having to constantly adjust the limits as the population changes.
Note that limits only affect work areas and automatic crafting, if you explicitly give an order, the limit is ignored.
	</string>
	
  <string name="help_resource_decay_title">Resource Decay</string>
  <string name="help_resource_decay_description">
Most resources and tools (b)decay(/b) over time, decay is also accelerated when tools are used.
Resources stored inside a structure, decay slowly. This is especially important for food, as it can mean the difference between having a good winter or massive starvation.
Some foods (b)decay very quickly(/b) like: Fruit, Berries or Raw Meat and Raw Fish.
Some foods (b)last a lot longer(/b) like: Grain, Cured Meat and Dry Fish.
Your people will try to eat the food that is going to decay sooner in order to preserve more durable food for later.
	</string>	
	
  <string name="help_workload_title">Workload</string>
  <string name="help_workload_description">
The (b)workload(/b) of your settlement is the ratio between the amount of tasks your people are trying to do, and the total amount of people.
If you ask your people to do too many things at once, they will be overworked, and will have trouble prioritizing the right tasks.
It is your job do make sure the amount of work to do is reasonable and proportional to the manpower available.
You can use the (b)tasks(/b) and (b)activity panels(/b) to see what your people are up to and how many of them are available to work.
	</string>
	
  <string name="help_human_roles_title">Human Roles</string>
  <string name="help_human_roles_description">
Depending on the age of your population they are able to perform different tasks:
(b)Children(/b). They can carry light resources around, one at a time, and do basic tasks that don't involve the usage of tools.
(b)Adults(/b). They are the most efficient of your people, they can carry a larger number of resources and perform any task.
(b)Elderly(/b). They can perform the same tasks as adults, but have less health and can carry less resources.
	</string>
  
  <string name="help_work_area_title">Work Areas</string>
  <string name="help_work_area_description">
Setting (b)work areas(/b) allows you to automate many of the (b)collection(/b) and (b)mining(/b) tasks in your settlement.
After you place an area for a given resource, people will keep collecting the resource within that area until the (b)resource limit(/b) is reached.
By default only one person at a time will work in a particular area, but you can increase their number in the selection panel.
  </string>
	
  <string name="help_foods_title">Foods</string>
  <string name="help_foods_description">
There are are different (b)types of food(/b) that your people can consume, it is important to understand the differences between them.
(b)Raw Fish(/b). Available all year long, every river or lake bank contains a certain amount of fish, once you exhaust it you need to wait for it to replenish. You can use the (b)Food Dryer(/b) to convert (b)Raw Fish(/b) to (b)Dry Fish(/b), which lasts a lot longer.
(b)Raw Meat(/b). You can hunt animals for their meat all year long, but in winter there will be a lot less of them around. You can use the (b)Food Dryer(/b) to convert (b)Raw Meat(/b) to (b)Cured Meat(/b), which lasts a lot longer.
(b)Berries(/b), (b)Fruit(/b) and (b)Nuts(/b). Available mostly in summer only, but some also in autumn. They don't last for long, but they are a good food to eat seasonally, so you can save non perishable foods for the winter.
(b)Pulses(/b). Available in summer, they require the right harvesting tools and technology to be processed. They last for a reasonable amount of time.
(b)Grain(/b). It lasts for an extremely long time, but requires processing to be eaten: First needs to be converted into (b)Flour(/b), then into (b)Bread(/b). This makes it quite labor intensive.
People will try to eat the foods that are about to perish first.
	</string>
	
  <string name="help_welfare_title">Welfare</string>
  <string name="help_welfare_description">
A measure of how well your settlement is doing.
Depends on your people's (b)stats(/b), (b)clothing(/b) and also on the (b)food surplus(/b).
If welfare is high (b)migrants(/b) will come to your settlement, the higher it is the more frequently they will arrive.
Welfare also affects the (b)birth rate(/b) in your settlement.
	</string>	
	
  <string name="help_prestige_title">Prestige</string>
  <string name="help_prestige_description">
A measure of how well known your settlement is.
Depends on your (b)population(/b), (b)buildings(/b) and (b)technology(/b).
If prestige is high (b)migrants(/b) and (b)traders(/b) will come more frequently to your settlement.
A good way to increase your settlement's (b)prestige(/b) is by constructing (b)megalithic(/b) structures.
	</string>		

	<!-- Conditions here refers to diseases or infections-->
  <string name="help_conditions_title">Conditions</string>
  <string name="help_conditions_description">
Humans can be affected by conditions such as (b)diseases(/b) or (b)infections(/b).
These are triggered from (b)going hungry(/b) repeatedly, or (b)sustaining injuries(/b).
When a person has a condition it's health will decrease for a given amount of time, if it reaches zero the person will die.
