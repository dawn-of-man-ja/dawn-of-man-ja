	<string name="tutorial_welcome_title">Welcome to Dawn of Man</string>
	
	<string name="tutorial_welcome">
In the game you control a band of (b)ancient humans(/b) striving for (b)survival(/b).
This tutorial explains the basics. You can check the (b)in-game help(/b) for more advanced directions.
	</string>

	<string name="tutorial_camera_controls_title">Camera controls</string>

	<string name="tutorial_camera_controls">
Dawn of Man uses FPS style camera controls.
Move the camera using the (camera_move_keys) keys.
Rotate the camera using the (camera_rotate_keys) keys.
Zoom the camera using the (b)mouse wheel(/b).
	</string>

	<string name="tutorial_camera_controls_done">
Note you can (b)pivot the camera(/b) around a point by (b)rotating and panning(/b) at the same time.
You can check out the more advanced controls in the help section, and (b)customize the keys(/b) in the (b)settings(/b) menu.
	</string>

	<string name="tutorial_fish_title">
Fishing
	</string>

	<string name="tutorial_fish">
Your people will need a (b)constant supply of food(/b) to stay alive.
One of the more predictable sources of food is (b)fish(/b) from (b)rivers(/b) and (b)lakes(/b).
To send people to fish, select a river, then click on the (b)fish button(/b).
	</string>

	<string name="tutorial_fish_done">
In general you can assign tasks to your people by (b)selecting(/b) objects like (b)trees(/b), (b)rivers(/b), (b)animals(/b), (b)structures(/b)..., then choosing one of the options in the selection panel.
	</string>

	<string name="tutorial_gather_title">
Materials
	</string>

	<string name="tutorial_gather">
Next you should be gathering some basic construction and crafting materials, like (b)Sticks(/b) and (b)Flint(/b).
	</string>

	<string name="tutorial_gather_done">
You now know how to (b)assign tasks to(/b) your people. This is a good way of (b)micromanaging(/b) them.
	</string>

	<string name="tutorial_work_areas_title">
Work Areas
	</string>

	<string name="tutorial_work_areas">
Too much (b)micromanagement(/b) is tedious and (b)inefficient(/b).
(b)Work areas(/b) are a way to give general commands to your settlement that people will perform continuously.
You can specify a (b)location(/b), a (b)resource limit(/b) and the (b)max number of people(/b) performing the action at one given time.
	</string>
	
	<string name="tutorial_work_areas_set_workers">
By default only one person at a time will go to any given (b)work area(/b), but you can increase this if required.
	</string>	
	
	<string name="tutorial_work_areas_done">
Well done, your people will now continuously gather resources until the (b)limit(/b) is reached.
Note that (b)Berries(/b) can only be gathered in (b)summer(/b), other resources in the game can only be gathered in a particular season.
	</string>		
	
	<string name="tutorial_tools_title">
Tools
	</string>

	<string name="tutorial_tools">
Some tasks, like hunting, fishing, butchering, harvesting, or mining, can only be performed if your people have the right (b)tools(/b).
These tools have to be crafted first, then your people will use them to perform the task.
	</string>	
	
	<string name="tutorial_crafting_title">
Crafting
	</string>

	<string name="tutorial_build_crafter">
Now that you have some raw resources, let's craft some (b)hunting tools(/b) with them.
The main crafting structure in the Stone Age is the (b)Crafter(/b), to build one, select the build option in the main menu, then the production button, then the crafter structure.
	</string>

	<string name="tutorial_craft_resources">
To craft tools, select the (b)Crafter(/b) then click on a tool recipe.
The crafting task will be added to the queue and one of your people will perform it as soon as they can.
Let's craft some (b)Wooden Spears(/b) to hunt animals and some (b)Bifaces(/b) to butcher them.
	</string>

	<string name="tutorial_craft_resources_done">
We now have all the tools we need to go hunting.
	</string>
	
	<string name="tutorial_hunting_title">
Hunting
	</string>
	
	<string name="tutorial_hunting">
(b)Hunting(/b) was a tricky business in the Stone Age. Killing a large animal with sticks and stones was no easy feat.
Use (b)primal vision(/b) to find easy prey (highlighted in green), avoid large animals and carnivores until you have the right tools and manpower.
To(b) hunt an animal(/b), select it, then click on the (b)hunting button(/b).
	</string>
	
	<string name="tutorial_hunting_done">
Once the animal has been hunted, your people will (b)butcher(/b) it and bring the (b)resources to camp(/b).
When hunting in this manner, your people will decide how many of them to send, based on the difficulty of the prey.
	</string>	
	
	<string name="tutorial_micromanagement_title">Micromanagement</string>	
		
	<string name="tutorial_micromanagement">
Sometimes, you might want more control over your people's actions.
You can do this by (b)selecting(/b) a few people, (b)then right clicking(/b) on the terrain or target.
This way you can (b)move people around(/b), or (b)assign(/b) one or more individuals to a particular (b)task(/b).
This is especially useful for hunting at the beginning of the game, when resources and manpower are limited.
	</string>
	
	<string name="tutorial_micromanagement_done">
You can check out the (b)help in the game(/b) for more detailed instructions on all the possible ways of controlling your people.
	</string>	
	
	<string name="tutorial_skin_processing_title">Skins</string>		
	
	<string name="tutorial_skin_processing">
One of the resources you obtain from animals is (b)Raw Skins(/b), they are used to craft clothing and build structures among other things.
However (b)Raw Skins(/b) can not be used directly, you have to dry them first, in order to do this you need to build (b)Skins Dryers(/b).
	</string>			
	
	<string name="tutorial_skin_processing_done">
Always keep a stock of (b)Dry Skins(/b) as they are a fundamental building and crafting material in the early eras.
	</string>
	
	<string name="tutorial_knowledge_title">Knowledge</string>				
	
	<string name="tutorial_knowledge">
In the game, you earn (b)knowledge points(/b) when doing certain actions: Hunting new animals, gathering new resources, reaching certain population levels, etc.
You can then use them to (b)research new techs(/b), which unlock new structures, plants or mechanics.
	</string>			

	<string name="tutorial_food_drying_title">Knowledge</string>					
	
	<string name="tutorial_food_drying">
The (b)Food Drying(/b) tech unlocks the (b)Food Dryer(/b), which allows you to process (b)Raw Meat(/b) and (b)Raw Fish(/b) into (b)Cured Meat(/b) and (b)Dry Fish(/b).
These last for a lot longer and can be (b)stored for the winter(/b) in a safe place.
	</string>			
	
	<string name="tutorial_food_drying_done">
Remember to always dry your food and keep it in a (b)storage(/b) structure to preserve it for as long as possible.
	</string>				
	
	<string name="tutorial_continuous_production_title">
Continuous Production
	</string>				
	
	<string name="tutorial_continuous_production">
Manually producing every item is tedious and (b)inefficient(/b).		
You can (b)right click(/b) on a recipe to toggle (b)continuous production(/b).
Your people will then keep on producing the item until the (b)resource limit(/b) is reached.
	</string>	
	
	<string name="tutorial_continuous_production_done">
Your people will now (b)continuously(/b) produce the tools until the (b)resource limit(/b) is reached.
Note that some recipes are set to continuous production by default.
	</string>				
	
	<string name="tutorial_expansion_title">Expansion</string>				
	
	<string name="tutorial_expansion">
If everyone is well fed and taken care of, your settlement will reach a high level of (b)welfare(/b) and (b)prestige(/b) and more people will want to join it.
For new people to join the village you have to build enough residence buildings to accommodate the new population, otherwise they will not come.
	</string>		
	
	<string name="tutorial_expansion_done">	
New humans will now join your settlement.
Note that your settlement can also grow when your people reproduce, this plays a more important role when you reach larger populations, as you can have a larger number of births. 
	</string>	
	
	<string name="tutorial_completed">
You now know the basics on how to run a settlement. Note that there are quite a few other mechanics in the game that are not explained here.
You can get more info from the (b)loading screen hints(/b), (b)UI tooltips(/b), or the (b)in-game(/b) help menu, that explains all the concepts in the game with a lot more detail.
